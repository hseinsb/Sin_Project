    archetype: "The Lover",

    shadow: "You chase sparks until you burn out. What begins as fire can become obsession. Your gift becomes your chain when you're chasing feeling instead of meaning.",
    path: "Let love be a sanctuary, not a storm. Anchor your passion in purpose. True intimacy begins when you stop trying to be touched ‚Äî and start allowing yourself to be seen."

    emoji: "ü´•",
    desire: "You don't want what they have ‚Äî you want to feel like they seem to feel. Admired. Fulfilled. Not left behind.",
    shadow: "Comparison is your poison. You measure your value through mirrors, not your own soul. Envy feeds your emptiness.",
    path: "Kill comparison with clarity. Your path was never meant to look like theirs. What's yours, will always find you."
